# High-Level Design (HLD)

## System Architecture

PhoneFlip is built as a single-page application (SPA) using React, with a focus on responsive design and user experience.

### Frontend Architecture
- **React**: For building the user interface components
- **React Router**: For client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with utility classes
- **ShadCN UI**: For pre-built UI components
- **Context API**: For state management

### Data Management
For the MVP, we'll use browser localStorage to persist data, with the ability to transition to a backend later.

## Component Structure
- **Layout Components**: Header, Footer, Layout wrapper
- **Page Components**: Home, Browse, ListingDetail, UserProfile, CreateListing
- **Feature Components**: SearchBar, FilterPanel, ListingCard, ListingForm
- **UI Components**: Button, Card, Input, Modal, etc.

## Navigation Flow
1. Home -> Browse Listings -> Listing Detail -> Contact/Purchase
2. Home -> Create Account -> User Profile
3. User Profile -> Create Listing -> Listing Management

## Responsive Design Strategy
- Mobile-first design approach
- Breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Flexible layouts using Flexbox and Grid

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for images and components
- Efficient state management to reduce re-renders
- Pagination for listing results

## Future Scalability
- Addition of a backend API
- Database integration
- Authentication system
- Payment processing
